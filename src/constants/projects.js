        Vitalize is a startup that provides trauma-informed digital wellness platform tailored to healthcare providers. 
        As a full-stack intern, I worked on creating meditation and journal pages for the app (react-native) and created corresponding backend API calls (Node.js and MongoDB).

      Positive Tracks is a non-profit organization that helps youth make social changes through physical activity.
      As a senior capstone project, our team (a group of 4 developers) created a event platform webpage where organizers can host/post an event, 
      Positive Tracks admin can assist organizers, and participants can browse/join events.

      As a research intern for Prof. Jan Holly, I worked on building a differential equation model that simulates a brainâ€™s spatial disorientation,
      the inability of a person to determine his true body position, motion, and altitude relative to the earth, in circular motions. 
      This model was applied to explain the cause of the helicopter crash in 2020 that killed Kobe Bryant and 7 others.
